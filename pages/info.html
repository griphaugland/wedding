                <h2>Time & Place</h2>
                The wedding will be held at Canyon Run Ranch, 395 N Rangeline Rd,
                Pleasant Hill, OH 45359 The ceremony will start at approximately
                4:30 PM on Friday, June 30th, 2023. After the ceremony, a reception
                will be held at the same venue in the old barn. The site of the
                ceremony is just a short walk from the barn.

                <h2>Attire</h2>
                Please wear formal attire. The average high temperature at the venue
                in June/July is approximately 84°F (29°C), so bear that in mind when
                choosing your outfit. Wear shoes that will allow you to enjoy a
                leisurely walk to the woods, where the ceremony will take place. You
                will regret those spiked heels, but a sturdy pair of wedges would
                work just fine. There are also golf carts available to shuttle those
                guests needing a little more assistance to get to and from the
                ceremony site.

              <div class="transportation">
                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                The wedding venue is located 75 minutes north of Cincinnati (90
                minutes from the Cincinnati Airport.) Guests are welcome to use
                their own method of transportation to and from the venue, but we
                will arrange a shuttle to and from the venue for those that do not
                have another method of transportation. Details about the shuttle
                departure times will be shared at a later date. Please make sure to
                indicate in your RSVP whether you wish to ride with the shuttle. The
                shuttle will return to Cincinnati after the conclusion of the
                wedding reception.
